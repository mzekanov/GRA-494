## CSS Methodology

I used my own variation of the BEM methodology. In regards to the naming conventions I named each section or div a "block(number)" except the navigation bar and footer. So for example the section directly below the navigation bar is called block1 and the text is labeled as "block1__text". If theres another container within the main div that contains the text it would be called "block1__container" and the text would be called "block1__container__text.
